  Dear baby,

  Thank you for the joy you’ve brought into my life. I truly treasure every moment we spend together, even if it’s just online. I love you with all my heart, and I never want to lose you.

  We may face more struggles and arguments in the future, but I hope we can stay strong together and overcome those challenges side by side. I really love you. I did say that you didn’t do anything for me, but that was not true. You gave me happiness the moment you entered my life.

  You may be distant at times, and because of that, I tend to overthink, but that’s fine as long as we’re still together at the end of the day. I hope that in the near future, we’ll feel even more comfortable with each other, and that we can fully trust one another. Trust is the foundation of every relationship. I won’t lie to you, because I know that lying leads to arguments and trust issues. I deeply care about you, and I will do anything to make our relationship work.

  I love you so much, my sweet girlfriend. I may be harsh on you sometimes because I get swept up in my emotions, but please know that I love you from the bottom of my heart. If possible, I’d like to spend the rest of my life with you, baby.
